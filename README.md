### Video game sales | Jul. 2024 - Dec. 2024

This project is an application developed as part of my portfolio, where I sought to combine various technologies and skills that I have recently learned. Mainly, it is a platform for selling video games similar to Steam, developed with Angular for the frontend and several microservices in C# with .NET Core for the backend.

The main objective of this project was to learn and apply Angular, along with the implementation of REST APIs, unit tests, and background tasks. This work allowed me not only to improve my technical knowledge, but also to understand the integration between frontend and backend systems in a professional environment.

### Clothing Store Ecommerce Project with Angular 17 | Ene 2024 - Mar 2024

This project was developed as part of my learning in Angular 17. It is an educational web application for an online clothing store that allows users to browse, search, purchase products, and more. Throughout the development, I implemented several key functionalities using Angular 17 services, components, and directives, as well as integration with APIs to obtain data and manage user authentication.

### PokeCard | Jul. 2023 - Oct 2023

This project, Autonomous, is made with HTML, CSS and JQuery. The Pok√©mon RESTfull API called PokeAPI was used. Bootstrap was also used for the carousel at the start. In addition, fonts with Pok√©mon-style typography were used.

This project, Autonomous, is a store for selling Pok√©mon cards. Some things that are implemented are the favorites with the local storage, a series of filters to search with a specific characteristic, a form in which the idea is that the buyer and seller communicate. The cards have information and characteristics of the Pok√©mon which are extracted from the ApiPoke. [Link Here](https://dorregobraian.github.io/PokeCardStore/)

This project, Universitario, is an online page for a fictitious municipality. In this project a user profile was implemented in which the user could rent books and see them in his profile. On the home page there is a list of books, the most popular ones and some publications. In the book list session 3 types of filters were implemented in which the user searches by author, title and date. The books can be bought or rented.
